# In-Game Validation Log

> **Purpose**: Track manual in-game testing for merged PRs. Unit tests, type checks, and CI only prove correctness of pure logic — anything touching player state, overlay rendering, or live game events needs human verification against the OSRS client. This file is the source of truth for "did the fix actually work for real users?"

> **Status legend**:

## Actuation-seam calibration — 2026-06-08 *(dev bridge harness 0.2, LOGIN_SCREEN)*

Calibration of the runelite-dev actuation seam before any acceptance-gate runner. Drove two
known cases through the dev bridge (`guidance.activate` -> `event.inject` -> `state.read`) with
synthetic local events only (no account, no game input). Full receipts:
`docs/guidance-audit/acceptance-runs/2026-06-08.md`.

| # | Status | Note |
|---|--------|------|
| #485 Phosani teleport-entry | `[x]` | **Fixed (does NOT reproduce).** Synthetic Drakan landing (3730,3336) advanced step 0->1 via `ARRIVE_AT_ZONE [3700,3290,3770,3360,0]` (client.log 09:22:12). PR #731 closed the 2026-05-27 Reg 1 freeze. |
| #729 Shades MANUAL step 3 | `[x]` | **Observer control.** Drove to index 2 (MANUAL "Pick up shade key"); injected playerMoved/chat/varbit -> stayed index 2 (no "Step 3 complete" line). Proves the harness detects genuine non-advance. |
| Visual canvas tier (arrow/overlay at target) | `[-]` | SKIPPED — login is manual; not logged in. Only overlay STATE asserted. |

**Gate + runner outcome:** the literal gate ("build the runner only if BOTH known failures
reproduce") was NOT met (#485 is fixed), but the operator explicitly opted to proceed with the
full runner. Runner built (session-orchestrated over the dev bridge; no harness rebuild) and run.
Full receipts: `docs/guidance-audit/acceptance-runs/2026-06-08.md`.

| Acceptance-run result | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Seam drives all reachable condition types to full completion | `[x]` | 4 sources driven to sequence-complete: General Graardor, The Nightmare, Zulrah, Barrows - covering TILE, ZONE, PLAYER_ON_PLANE, VARBIT, ACTOR_DEATH, CHAT. |
| Visual/overlay tier (logged in) | `[x]` | Guidance overlay/panel renders live on activation (screenshot local-only; RSN withheld). |
| Finding 1 (harness reliability) - synthetic ARRIVE_AT_TILE completion is state-dependent | `[x]` | NOT a login-state confound (an earlier draft's claim was refuted). Single-inject ARRIVE_AT_TILE completes on a fresh client but is unreliable after account-load (Graardor/Zulrah/Vorkath/Vet'ion/Skotizo travel steps); move-away-then-arrive recovers it inconsistently. Non-tile conditions reliable in all states. Harness limitation, not a real-player bug. |
| Finding 2 (data) - 5 ACTOR_DEATH steps have no completion NPC id | `[!]` | Catacombs of Kourend, TzHaar, Stronghold of Security, Champion's Challenge, My Notes - cannot auto-advance in real play. Follow-up fix needed (wire ids / match-any / MANUAL). |
| Per-source sweep (8 selected) | `[~]` | 4 PASS (full completion), 2 calibration PASS, 3 PARTIAL (Finding-1 TILE quirk), Catacombs static-FAIL (Finding 2). Recommended harness follow-up: a `guidance.advance` (manual-Next) bridge action to step past the quirk and drive MANUAL/INVENTORY steps. |

## N1 ARRIVE_AT_ZONE completion + C2 inert-loop cleanup (minigames) — pending in-game validation

Five minigame Queue steps used `ARRIVE_AT_ZONE` with no `completionZone` (could never
auto-advance) and carried a co-located `loopBackToStep`+`loopCount:0` round step that never
engages the engine. Player-facing condition changes below need an in-game pass to confirm the
Queue step auto-advances when the player enters the boxed arena/lobby (or talks to the NPC).
Zone corners cited from authoritative spawns: Captain Cain 1657 @ (2534,3568); Castle Wars
arena region 9520 (Zamorak flag 2371,3133 / Saradomin flag 2428,3074); Nomad 10555 @
(2212,2857); Lisa 7320 @ (3141,3636).

| Source | Player-facing change to validate | Status | Branch | Re-validated |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Barbarian Assault | Queue step now completes on talking to Captain Cain (NPC_TALKED_TO, npcId 1657) instead of a zoneless ARRIVE_AT_ZONE; round step no longer carries an inert loop | `[ ]` | fix/n1-arrive-zone-conditions | `[ ]` |
| Castle Wars | Queue step auto-advances when player enters the arena zone `[2368,3072,2432,3135,0]` (region 9520) after a team portal | `[ ]` | fix/n1-arrive-zone-conditions | `[ ]` |
| Soul Wars | Queue step auto-advances when player is in the Isle of Souls lobby zone `[2190,2840,2240,2880,0]` (Nomad's camp) | `[ ]` | fix/n1-arrive-zone-conditions | `[ ]` |
| Last Man Standing | Queue step auto-advances when player is in the Ferox LMS lobby zone `[3125,3622,3160,3648,0]` (around Lisa) | `[ ]` | fix/n1-arrive-zone-conditions | `[ ]` |
| Pest Control | Queue step is now MANUAL (deferred): the stored coord is the outpost the player already stands on; the true target is the instanced Pest Control island whose coords the data lacks. **TODO: capture the on-island arena coords in-game and upgrade this step back to ARRIVE_AT_ZONE with a real completionZone.** | `[ ]` | fix/n1-arrive-zone-conditions | `[ ]` |

## Validation pass — Wave 1 (smoke + hub regressions + #699-#727 UX) — 2026-05-27 *(HEAD 48134711)*

Operator-driven pass after the #699-#727 panel/guidance UX wave merged with no validation records. Earlier hub blockers (#485/#483/#486/#487/#488/#611) are all CLOSED, clearing the 2026-05-16 pause. Operator went AFK in Castle Wars partway through, so travel/active-play rows were deferred; stationary panel/overlay/debug-overlay rows were completed (verified by screenshot + log).

### Summary
- PASS: 9  ·  FAIL: 1  ·  DEFERRED (needs active play): 7

| # | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Smoke 1 — client loads, no stack traces | `[x]` | Booted 08:00:23 `Collection Log Helper started`; no CLH exception/AssertionError in login storm. Only ERROR is `shortestpath.transport` (different plugin — noise). |
| Smoke 2 — login no hang (#677) | `[x]` | Reached game world, zero `scripts are not reentrant`. |
| Smoke 3 — 6 panel modes render | `[x]` | Efficient/Category/Search/Pet Hunt/Statistics/Dry Streaks all clean. |
| Smoke 4 — guidance activates panel+overlay | `[x]` | Non-Mort'ton source: button→Stop, step strip + overlay both render, state in sync. |
| Reg 1 (#485 class) — ARRIVE_AT_TILE auto-advance | `[!]` | **FAIL — Phosani's Nightmare.** Teleported to Slepe via Drakan's medallion + entered via shortcut; step 1/4 (`ARRIVE_AT_TILE` (3728,3302) r=20) never fired, froze whole chain. Object 32637 stairs verified at (3727,3300) → stored coord correct to 2 tiles → **predicate code is fine; it's a data/design gap**: tile-radius arrival can't catch teleport/shortcut entry that lands >20 tiles away. #727 exonerated (only jumps forward, logs "State-derived start" — never logged). Manual Skip advances fine → **isolated, NOT systemic** (unlike the original #485). Logged here; issue draft ready, not yet filed (operator: "just log it"). |
| Reg 3 (#486/#487/#611) — C7 debug overlay | `[x]` | C1 teleport inventory, C2 equipped, C3 diary-per-region, C4 cape perks, C5 sub-milestones all populated; quest count reads correct (#487 fixed). |
| #699 — panel header | `[x]` | Count overlaid on green progress bar (`820/17xx (48.2%)`), `● Synced` indicator, **no manual sync buttons** (auto-sync-on-login). |
| #457/#401 — requirements header | `[x]` | Green `Priest in Peril — COMPLETED` (Phosani's) + `Shades of Mort'ton — COMPLETED` (Shades), above the step strip. |
| #458/#402 — collapsible step sections | `[x]` | Shades: `▼ Bank prep (1 step)` auto-expanded (active), `▶ Skilling (1 step)` / `▶ Loot (3 steps)` collapsed. |
| #705 — color-coded item text list | `[x]` | Shades step 1 "Items needed": Tinderbox gold (in bank), Phrin remains + Oak pyre logs red (missing). Palette matches constants `HELD (40,180,40)` / `IN_BANK (200,180,40)` / `MISSING (200,40,40)`. Renders as text list, not chips. |
| #443 — UTF-8 overlay charset | `[x]` | (incidental) Phosani's overlay step text renders `->` and apostrophes with no mojibake. |
| Reg 2 (#483) — Hard Clue panel/advance | `[-]` | DEFERRED — needs a hard clue + travel. |
| #472 — recommended chips | `[-]` | DEFERRED — no Recommended section on Shades step 1; needs a step that carries `recommendedItemIds`. |
| #713/#718 — auto-stop on clog obtain (not mid-loop) | `[-]` | DEFERRED — needs obtaining a target item. |
| #721 — restock reset on depleted loop | `[-]` | DEFERRED — needs Shades catacomb key/remains depletion. |
| #714/#715/#720 — object glow + book marker | `[-]` | DEFERRED — needs target NPC/object in render distance. |
| #726 — overlay/panel item-availability sync | `[-]` | DEFERRED — needs a target step with items + target in view. |
| #727 — start-step forward jump | `[~]` | Negative-tested only: activating from Castle Wars (no confirmable area) correctly did NOT false-jump. Positive jump (activate mid-activity in a confirmable area) still to exercise. |

### Reg 1 reproducer (issue draft — not yet filed)
1. Have Drakan's medallion (Sins of the Father complete). Stand anywhere far from Slepe.
2. Guide Me on Phosani's Nightmare → opens step 1/4 (`Walk to Slepe`).
3. Drakan's medallion → Slepe (lands ~3730,3336) and/or enter the sanctuary via the shortcut.
4. Observe: step stays 1/4; never auto-advances; whole chain frozen. Manual Skip works.
- Root cause: step 1 `ARRIVE_AT_TILE` at the church stairs (3728,3302) r=20; medallion/shortcut entry lands >20 tiles away, so arrival never registers. Fix on the data side (ARRIVE_AT_ZONE over Slepe, or add the shortcut/landing as a completion waypoint). Audit other teleport-entry travel steps for the same gap.

## PR #677 — Login reentrancy crash fix *(merged 2026-05-25, validated 2026-05-25)*

Closes #676. `PlayerQuestProgressState.onVarbitChanged` ran `Quest.getState` (a clientscript) mid-login-script → `AssertionError: scripts are not reentrant`, hanging the client at "Connecting to server...". Fixed by deferring the refresh via `ClientThread.invokeLater` with a coalescing guard.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Log in on a populated account; reaches the game world (no hang at "Connecting to server") | `[x]` | 2026-05-25: `LOGGED_IN` reached; no `scripts are not reentrant` in the log across multiple logins. |
| 2 | No `scripts are not reentrant` AssertionError during the login varbit storm | `[x]` | 2026-05-25: zero occurrences. |
| 3 | Quest-dependent state populates after login (Lost City / RFD / Fairytale II milestones resolve) | `[x]` | 2026-05-25: `QuestProgressState refreshed` shows all milestones resolving correctly. |

## PR #682 — Guidance panel flash on inventory change *(merged 2026-05-25, validated 2026-05-25)*

Closes #681. `GuidanceSequencer.onInventoryChanged` re-notified the unchanged step on every `ItemContainerChanged`, blinking the "Items needed" section. Fixed via idempotent `StepProgressView.showStep` + skipping the empty re-notify push; bundled with flicker-free `removeAll` rebuild, idempotent recommended-chip strip, and an off-EDT `getItemComposition` catch.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activate guidance on a Slayer/minigame source; gain XP / change inventory repeatedly — "Items needed" section does NOT flash | `[x]` | 2026-05-25: no flash on XP drops; confirmed live on Shades of Mort'ton. |
| 2 | "Items needed" status stays live — items tick to satisfied as you withdraw/loot them (liveness preserved) | `[x]` | 2026-05-25: updated correctly when looting items from bank for the Mort'ton task. |
| 3 | Recommended-gear chip strip renders without crashing on guidance activation (#679 off-EDT catch) | `[x]` | 2026-05-25: chips render; zero `must be called on client thread` errors this session. |
| 4 | No regression to the list rebuild / mode switching (flicker-free `removeAll`) | `[x]` | 2026-05-25: panel renders normally; full test suite green (1668 tests). |

> Follow-ups still open (filed this session, unfixed by design): **#678** (skill enum `RUNECRAFTING` → `RUNECRAFT`), **#679** (resolve chip item names on the client thread — proper fix; the #682 catch only stops the crash), **#680** (Requirements row formats "Shades Of Mortton" instead of "Shades of Mort'ton").

## PR #379 — RuneLite client bump 1.12.24 -> 1.12.26.3 *(merged 2026-05-10)*

## PR #372 — Shades of Mort'ton guidance fixes *(merged 2026-05-11)*

Closes #366 (step ordering + arrival distance), #367 (skip overlay refresh), #375 (mid-sequence panel render), #376 (shade-key tile).

> NOTE: PR #372 set Mort'ton step 1's description to "Bank: bring pyre logs, shade remains, and a tinderbox to Mort'ton". After PR #384 merged, the description is technically misleading (there's no bank step anymore). If item-requirements UX is confusing in testing, the description can be edited in a small follow-up to "Travel to Mort'ton (bring pyre logs, shade remains, and a tinderbox)" without touching code.

| # | Issue | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | #366-B | Mort'ton teleport scroll -> step 1 (travel) auto-completes within ~1 second of landing | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | #366-B | Minigame teleport -> Shades of Mort'ton -> step 1 auto-completes on landing | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | #366-B | Fairy ring BKR -> step 1 auto-completes on landing | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | #366-B | Barrows teleport, run south to Mort'ton -> step 1 auto-completes near town centre, NOT at the river | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | #367 | Mid-sequence click **Skip** -> object highlight, tile marker, and panel all update in the same tick (no visible 1-tick gap) | `[ ]` | |
| 6 | #367 | Mid-sequence click **Next Step** -> same behavior as Skip | `[ ]` | |
| 7 | #367 | Skip rapidly across 3 steps -> no orphaned overlays from prior steps | `[ ]` | |
| 8 | #375 | Mid-sequence landing: stand at funeral pyres with a shade key + pyre logs + remains, activate guidance -> blue box shows landed step 3/5, InfoBox reads **3/5** not **1/5** | `[ ]` | |
| 9 | #375 | All-satisfied: pre-meet every condition for the source, activate guidance -> deactivates cleanly, NO empty "Step 1/0:" box | `[ ]` | |
| 10 | #375 | Plain start: fresh inv at Lumbridge, activate Shades of Mort'ton -> blue box shows step 1/N (regression check for the common path) | `[ ]` | |
| 11 | #376 | While on step 3/5 -> tile marker is INSIDE Mort'ton temple at ~(3495, 3298) near reward pillar, not on surface near the pyre | `[ ]` | |

## PR #384 — Surface required-item availability; remove bank-step routing *(merged 2026-05-11)*

Closes #380. Major behavior change: `requiredItemIds` now surface as colored entries in the panel + in-game overlay instead of substituting a synthetic GE bank step.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activate Shades of Mort'ton with no tinderbox -> active step is **step 1 (travel)**, NOT a synthetic "Get required items from bank" step | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Side panel: required-items section shows **Tinderbox** with RED border + "(MISSING)" tooltip | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | In-game overlay (top-left): "Item requirements:" header + "Tinderbox" line rendered in red | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Withdraw tinderbox -> panel row turns GREEN with "(in inventory)" tooltip; overlay line turns green | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | With tinderbox in BANK only -> panel row YELLOW with "(in bank)" tooltip; overlay shows "Tinderbox (bank)" yellow | `[ ]` | |
| 6 | Equip a `requiredItemIds` item -> panel shows GREEN with "(equipped)" tooltip | `[ ]` | |
| 7 | Walk onto the active step's tile -> minimal overlay panel renders WITH only the requirements list when items are required; NO panel when no items are required | `[ ]` | |
| 8 | Activate a source whose current step has no `requiredItemIds` -> no "Item requirements:" section appears | `[ ]` | |
| 9 | World map view -> route overlay still draws correctly (regression check) | `[ ]` | |
| 10 | Trigger Skip on a step with required items -> next step's requirements render in same tick | `[ ]` | |
| 11 | Stop guidance -> requirements section disappears from both panel and overlay | `[ ]` | |
| 12 | Switch sources without stopping (panel-driven mode change) -> stale items from previous source don't leak | `[ ]` | |

## PR #390 (fix/373-overlay-toggle-preserves-guidance) — Show Overlays toggle no longer kills the guidance session *(merged 2026-05-11)*

Closes cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#373. Removes the early-return at the top of `GuidanceOverlayCoordinator.activateGuidance` that aborted the whole call when `config.showOverlays()` was false. Since cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#386 added per-overlay self-gating, the early-return is now redundant *and* wrong: toggling Show Overlays off should hide overlays (which #386 already does), not refuse to start guidance.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | With Show Overlays OFF, click Guide Me on any source → panel button changes to "Stop Guidance", banner shows "Guiding: X", step progress widget appears in panel, but NO 3D world overlays render | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | While guidance is active with Show Overlays OFF, toggle Show Overlays ON → overlays appear immediately at the current step's target (without re-clicking Guide Me) | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | While guidance is active with Show Overlays ON, toggle Show Overlays OFF → overlays disappear immediately but guidance stays active (panel button stays "Stop Guidance") | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Repeat toggle cycle 3 times rapidly → state stays consistent each cycle; no stuck buttons; no console errors | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | Stop Guidance manually with Show Overlays OFF → button returns to "Guide Me", banner clears | `[ ]` | |
| 6 | Regression: Show Overlays ON + Guide Me on Shades of Mort'ton → still works as in cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#389 (panel + overlay both populate) | `[ ]` | |

## PR fix/step-progress-view-client-thread — StepProgressView tooltip lookup no longer crashes *(pending merge)*

Closes the same class of bug as cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#389 but on the side-panel widget. `StepProgressView.updateRequiredItemDisplay` calls `itemManager.getItemComposition(itemId).getName()` to build tooltips for each required-item icon — but that runs on the EDT (the widget is a Swing panel), and `getItemComposition` asserts caller-is-client-thread. The `AssertionError` aborted the loop mid-iteration, leaving the required-items strip hidden in the panel and dumping stack traces to `client.log`.

Minimal fix: wrap the `getItemComposition` call in `try / catch (Throwable)`, falling back to `"Item #N"` for the tooltip. Loop completes, panel renders icons + colored borders correctly; only tooltips degrade to IDs when on EDT.

A proper architectural fix (pre-resolved `List<RequiredItemDisplay>` passed from coordinator on client thread) is queued as a follow-up; out of scope here to keep the PR minimal.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activate guidance on a source with `requiredItemIds` (e.g. Shades of Mort'ton step 1) → side-panel required-items strip shows item icons with colored borders | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Hover over an item icon → tooltip shows either the item name (if cache loaded on EDT) OR "Item #N (in inventory / bank / MISSING)" — both acceptable, no crash | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | Open `client.log` after a Guide Me click → ZERO `Uncaught exception` lines pointing at `StepProgressView.updateRequiredItemDisplay` | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Cycle Guide Me → Stop Guidance → Guide Me 5 times → required-items strip renders each time, no degradation | `[ ]` | |

## PR fix/381-hint-arrow-refresh-after-teleport — Hint arrow re-applies after long-distance teleport *(pending merge)*

Closes cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#381. After teleporting away mid-guidance (e.g. Mort'ton → Grand Exchange via bank teleport, then back), the in-game hint arrow stayed cleared at the new step's target location. `client.setHintArrow(WorldPoint)` is bound to the loaded scene — when the scene reloaded, the arrow target was no longer rendered and walking back into range did not auto-restore it. Before this fix, only step transitions and the "Show Hint Arrow" config toggle re-set the arrow; neither fires on a teleport.

Fix: introduces a new small focused class `com.collectionloghelper.guidance.GuidanceMovementTracker` (~160 lines, single responsibility) that subscribes to `GameTick` and tracks the player's WorldPoint each tick while guidance is active. When the single-tick Chebyshev delta exceeds 10 tiles (running caps at 2 tiles/tick — any single-tick jump >10 is unambiguously a teleport) or the plane changes, it calls `GuidanceOverlayCoordinator.refreshHintArrow()`. That existing method already gates on `config.showHintArrow()` and the active step's world target, so the tracker fires unconditionally on teleport and lets the coordinator decide whether to set, clear, or no-op. Extracted as a separate class (rather than another handler on `GuidanceEventRouter`, which already has 10 subscribers and 549 lines) so future movement-driven guidance behavior (e.g. step regression on player-left-step-location for cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#378) can live alongside it.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activate guidance on a multi-step source (Shades of Mort'ton). Mid-sequence, teleport away (Grand Exchange teleport). Teleport back to Mort'ton → hint arrow (minimap + in-game tile arrow) reappears at the current step's target WITHOUT having to Stop / Start Guidance | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | With "Show Hint Arrow" config DISABLED, teleport long-distance during active guidance → no arrow appears (refresh respects the toggle) | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | Plane change mid-guidance (climb a ladder, enter a basement) → hint arrow re-applies at the current step's target on the new plane | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Ordinary walking 10+ ticks across a normal scene boundary (no teleport) → arrow does NOT flicker / churn (no false-positive refresh) | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | Stop Guidance, teleport, Start Guidance fresh → first tick re-baselines silently; no spurious refresh from prior baseline | `[ ]` | |
| 6 | Step transitions mid-session still fire arrow updates (existing applyStepToOverlays path unchanged) | `[ ]` | |
| 7 | client.log grep for `IllegalStateException` / `AssertionError` from `setHintArrow` after teleport → should be ZERO entries (refresh runs through coordinator which dispatches on client thread) | `[ ]` | |

## PR fix/374-locked-items-natural-position — Locked items rank by score, not segregated *(merged 2026-05-11, PR #392)*

Closes cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#374. Three identical `Comparator.comparing(ScoredItem::isLocked).thenComparing(...)` chains in `EfficiencyCalculator` (`rankByEfficiency`, `filterByCategory`, `filterPetsOnly`) sorted by `isLocked` first — pushing every locked item to the bottom of the list regardless of its score. Removed the segregation key: score-only sort. Locked items keep their `isLocked` flag for the renderer (red highlight + lock icon + tooltip), they just appear in their natural efficiency position now.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Efficient mode with a locked source whose score sits between two unlocked ones → locked source appears INTERLEAVED, not at the bottom | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Locked source still renders with red highlight + lock icon (renderer unchanged) | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | Hover the locked source → tooltip names the unmet requirement (quest / skill / diary) | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Toggle Hide Locked Content ON → locked sources still disappear entirely (no regression from cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#387) | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | Category Focus mode with mixed locked/unlocked sources → same interleaving behavior | `[ ]` | |
| 6 | Top Pick still picks the highest-score UNLOCKED source (locked sources can't be Top Pick — `findFirst().filter(!isLocked)` semantics intact) | `[ ]` | |

## PR fix/required-items-client-thread — Guide Me activation regression *(pending merge)*

Closes the regression surfaced by trace from PR #388: Guide Me on any source with `requiredItemIds` (e.g. Shades of Mort'ton) silently failed because `RequiredItemResolver.lookupName` called `ItemManager.getItemComposition()` from the EDT, which throws `AssertionError("must be called on client thread")`. The original catch only caught `RuntimeException`, so the assertion propagated up and aborted `activateGuidance` mid-flight — leaving the overlay state set but the panel state stale ("Guide Me" instead of "Stop Guidance").

Two-layer fix:
1. `GuidanceOverlayCoordinator.applyStepToOverlays` now dispatches the resolve + set onto `clientThread.invokeLater()`.
2. `RequiredItemResolver.lookupName` widens its catch from `RuntimeException` to `Throwable` (belt-and-suspenders) so a future caller that forgets the client-thread contract can't silently kill activation again.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Click Guide Me on Top Pick "Shades of Mort'ton" (Bronze lock) → panel button changes to "Stop Guidance" AND in-game overlay shows step 1 content. State stays in sync. | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Click Stop Guidance → panel button returns to "Guide Me" AND overlay clears. | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | Click Guide Me from the Bronze lock item-detail view → button changes correctly there too. | `[ ]` | |

## PR fix/364-config-triggered-panel-rebuild — Filter-config toggles trigger panel rebuild *(pending merge)*

Closes #364 (Hide Locked Content toggle inert). Approach: extends the `@Subscribe onConfigChanged` handler added in fix/363 with a `FILTER_CONFIG_KEYS` set; when any of those keys change, fires a plugin-supplied callback that flips `pendingPanelRebuild = true` + `rankedSourcesDirty = true`. Next game-tick coalesces a single rebuild against the new filter state.

Covers six toggles previously broken or untested for mid-session changes:
`hideLockedContent`, `hideObtainedItems`, `accountType`, `raidTeamSize`, `afkFilter`, `efficientSortMode`.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Toggle Hide Locked Content ON mid-session -> within 1 tick (~600ms) the list rebuilds; locked items disappear from Efficient / Category / Search lists | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Toggle Hide Locked Content OFF again -> locked items return at their natural efficiency position (red highlight + lock icon) | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | Toggle Hide Obtained Items ON -> sources with no missing items disappear within 1 tick | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Switch Account Type Main -> Iron mid-session -> efficiency list re-ranks; iron-only sources change visibility / position | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | Switch Raid Team Size SOLO -> FIVE -> raid sources re-rank with team-size-adjusted efficiency | `[ ]` | |
| 6 | Switch Efficient Sort Mode (Efficiency -> Time, etc.) -> list re-orders within 1 tick | `[ ]` | |
| 7 | Adjust Efficient AFK Filter -> list re-filters by AFK level within 1 tick | `[ ]` | |
| 8 | Regression: change Overlay Color or NPC Highlight Style -> panel does NOT pointlessly rebuild (toggle non-filter key with side panel open; check there's no visual flicker) | `[ ]` | |
| 9 | Regression: rapid-fire-toggle Hide Locked Content 5 times in <1s -> panel rebuilds once on the next tick (coalesced via `pendingPanelRebuild`); no console errors | `[ ]` | |

## PR fix/363-config-toggle-propagation — Config toggles propagate immediately *(pending merge)*

Closes #363 (Show Overlays / Show Hint Arrow toggles inert mid-guidance). Approach: each overlay self-gates on `config.showOverlays()` at render time (cheap volatile read per frame); `@Subscribe onConfigChanged` handler revokes / re-applies `client.setHintArrow()` since that's a one-shot client mutation rather than a render-loop predicate.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activate guidance, toggle **Show Overlays** OFF -> object highlight, tile marker, world map route, NPC outline, dialog highlight, ground item highlight, and the top-left guidance overlay panel all disappear within 1 frame (~50ms) | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Toggle Show Overlays ON -> overlays return immediately (state was preserved, just gated) | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | Toggle Show Overlays OFF while sync/bank reminders are visible -> reminders remain (independent of overlay toggle) | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Activate guidance, toggle **Show Hint Arrow** OFF -> in-game tile arrow + minimap arrow clear immediately | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | Toggle Show Hint Arrow ON mid-guidance -> arrow re-renders on current step's target | `[ ]` | |
| 6 | Toggle Show Hint Arrow rapidly off/on/off/on -> no stale arrows, no errors in console | `[ ]` | |
| 7 | Without guidance active, toggle Show Hint Arrow ON -> no arrow appears (correct: no target) | `[ ]` | |
| 8 | Activate guidance on a clue-tier source (no step target) -> Show Hint Arrow toggle has no visible effect (correct: no target to point at) | `[ ]` | |
| 9 | Regression: skip button mid-guidance with Show Overlays ON -> overlays update on next tick (matches pre-fix behavior) | `[ ]` | |

## PR #396 — B.5.6 NPC and object outline-glow highlight style *(pending merge)*

Closes cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#377. Refs cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#382 (B.5.6).

Adds `OUTLINE_GLOW` to `NpcHighlightStyle` and a new `ObjectHighlightStyle` enum (also gains `HULL` as the legacy option). Defaults flip to `OUTLINE_GLOW` for both. Uses RuneLite's native `ModelOutlineRenderer.drawOutline(actor/tileObject, width=6, color, feather=4)` — exposed in 1.12.26.3, no custom vertex projection needed. Existing `HULL` paths preserved for backwards compatibility.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activate guidance on a source with an NPC step (e.g. Vorkath, Cerberus) → the target NPC renders with a glowing model outline, not a clickbox / hull polygon | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Activate guidance on a source with an object step (e.g. Shades of Mort'ton funeral pyre, GWD door) → the target object renders with the same outline-glow style | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | Config → NPC Highlight Style → switch from `OUTLINE_GLOW` to `HULL` → bounding hull returns immediately (no Stop/Start required, propagation from PR #386) | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Config → Object Highlight Style → switch from `OUTLINE_GLOW` to `HULL` → bounding hull returns for objects | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | Both styles set back to `OUTLINE_GLOW` → outline returns | `[ ]` | |
| 6 | Outline colour matches the `Overlay Color` config setting (change it to a vivid colour to verify) | `[ ]` | |
| 7 | Multi-form NPC mid-fight (Zulrah, Hydra) → outline tracks the current form's model | `[ ]` | |
| 8 | Walk a long distance from the highlighted target → outline keeps tracking until target leaves render distance, then disappears cleanly (no lingering outline ghost) | `[ ]` | |
| 9 | FPS check: 30 seconds parked in a busy scene (GE) with guidance active → no perceptible FPS drop vs `HULL` mode (outline should be free per-frame from `ModelOutlineRenderer` cache) | `[ ]` | |
| 10 | Regression: NPC indicator / object indicator stock RuneLite plugins still render their own highlights independently (don't conflict with ours) | `[ ]` | |
| 11 | `client.log` after 5 minutes of guidance → ZERO stack traces mentioning `ModelOutlineRenderer` or `drawOutline` | `[ ]` | |

## PR #397 — B.5.5 per-step world map arrow and destination icon *(pending merge)*

Refs cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#382 (B.5.5).

New `WorldMapDestinationOverlay` (338 LOC) adds two world-map visuals tied to the active guidance step:
- **Edge-snap directional arrow** at the world-map boundary when the destination tile is off-screen (8 pre-rendered sprites, every 45°).
- **Destination icon** at the target tile when it is on-screen:
  - NPC step (has `npcId` / `npcName`) → person silhouette icon
  - Object step (has `objectId`) → chest icon
  - Otherwise → diamond tile marker

Wired through `GuidanceOverlayCoordinator` (`setTarget` on `applyStepToOverlays` / `applySourceToOverlays`; `clearTarget` on `deactivateGuidance` and the no-location step branch). `WorldMapRouteOverlay` is untouched — both render layers coexist.

> **Known visual overlap flagged by the worker**: when the destination is off-screen, both this overlay's arrow AND the existing `CollectionLogWorldMapPoint` edge-snap chevron will draw simultaneously. Same teal colour, so visually consistent, but worth a product decision in tests 6–7 below. Easy fix either direction.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |

| 1 | Activate guidance on a source with an NPC step. Open world map → on-screen destination shows a **person silhouette** icon at the target tile | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Activate guidance on a source with an object step (chest, door). Open world map → on-screen destination shows a **chest** icon at the target tile | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | Activate guidance on a clue-tier / generic source. Open world map → on-screen destination shows a **diamond tile marker** | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Pan the world map so the destination scrolls off-screen → **edge-snap arrow** appears at the map boundary pointing toward the destination; the on-screen icon disappears | `[ ]` | |

## PR #398 — B.5.1 per-step item requirements with bank-scan state colouring *(pending merge)*

Refs cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#382 (B.5.1).

Adds an "Items needed:" subsection to `StepProgressView` that lists each entry in the **current step's** `requiredItemIds` with availability colouring:
- **Green** name label: item held in inventory OR worn
- **White** name label + small ℹ icon + tooltip "in bank": present in last bank scan
- **Red** name label: not found anywhere

`StepProgressView` no longer takes `PlayerInventoryState` / `PlayerBankState` directly. It receives pre-resolved `List<RequiredItemDisplay>` rows produced on the **client thread** by `RequiredItemResolver`, then pushed to the EDT (avoids the `ItemManager` client-thread assert seen in #388 / #389). `GuidanceOverlayCoordinator` defers resolution via `clientThread.invokeLater` in both `activateGuidance` and `onStepChanged` paths.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activate guidance on Shades of Mort'ton (step 1 has `requiredItemIds`: tinderbox + pyre logs + shade remains) → side panel renders an "Items needed:" header followed by one row per required item | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Required item in INVENTORY → row name renders in GREEN | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | Required item EQUIPPED → row name renders in GREEN (treated same as inventory) | `[ ]` | |

| 5 | Required item missing from inventory, equipment, AND bank → row name renders in RED | `[ ]` | |
| 6 | Activate guidance on a source whose current step has no `requiredItemIds` (e.g. Vorkath if no required items, or a clue tier) → NO "Items needed:" header appears | `[ ]` | |
| 7 | Pick up a MISSING required item from the floor → row transitions RED → GREEN on the next tick without rebuilding the whole panel | `[ ]` | |
| 8 | Drop a required item from inventory while standing in front of a bank (so it's still in bank) → row transitions GREEN → WHITE | `[ ]` | |
| 9 | Drop the required item somewhere it's NOT in bank → row transitions GREEN → RED | `[ ]` | |
| 10 | Step advance (auto-arrival or Next Step) to a step whose `requiredItemIds` differs → "Items needed:" list refreshes to the new step's items in the same tick (no stale entries) | `[ ]` | |
| 11 | Step advance to a step with no `requiredItemIds` → header disappears cleanly | `[ ]` | |
| 12 | Equipped item rendering: equip a required item → tooltip on the row says "in inventory" or "equipped" (either acceptable as long as the colour is GREEN) | `[ ]` | |
| 13 | Open bank to refresh bank scan, then close → row that was RED (item only in bank, scan stale) refreshes to WHITE | `[ ]` | |
| 14 | Stop Guidance → "Items needed:" subsection disappears with the rest of the step strip | `[ ]` | |

## PR #401 — B.5.3 General requirements (quest/skill/diary) in guidance header *(merged 2026-05-13)*

Refs cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#382 (B.5.3).

When guidance activates, a "Requirements:" subsection appears below the "Guiding: \<source\>" headline (above the step strip), listing each prerequisite as a coloured row:
- Quest: GREEN (COMPLETED) / YELLOW (IN PROGRESS) / RED (NOT STARTED)
- Skill: GREEN (level met) / RED (level short, shows "level X/Y")
- Diary: GREEN (COMPLETED) / RED (NOT COMPLETED)
- Hidden entirely when source has no requirements.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |

| 1 | Activate guidance on a multi-requirement source (e.g. Cerberus → 91 Slayer) → "Requirements:" subsection appears under the headline | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Player meets a skill requirement → row renders GREEN, format like "Slayer 91/91" | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | Player short on a skill requirement → row renders RED, format like "Slayer 85/91" | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Quest requirement met → row renders GREEN with "COMPLETED" | `[ ]` | |

## PR #402 — B.5.4 Collapsible step sections via `section` field on `GuidanceStep` *(merged 2026-05-13)*

Refs cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#382 (B.5.4).

Adds a `String section` field to `GuidanceStep` (additive, backwards compatible — null = legacy flat layout). When ANY step on the active source has `section` set, `StepProgressView` groups consecutive same-section steps into collapsible blocks. Active step's section auto-expands. Null-section steps fall into an "Other" group.

> **Validation note**: No source in `drop_rates.json` has a `section` field set yet (data backfill is a follow-up milestone B.5.4b). Most in-client checks here are **regression checks** that the existing flat layout is unchanged. The sectioned-layout behaviour is currently only exercised by unit tests; in-client validation will expand once sections are authored on real sources.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activate guidance on any multi-step source (e.g. Shades of Mort'ton) → step strip renders in the legacy flat layout, identical to pre-#402 master | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Step strip shows all steps in order with the existing "Items needed:" subsection attached to the active step | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | Auto-advance through 2–3 steps mid-session → strip updates per step, no section-header artefacts appear | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Skip / Next Step buttons work as before | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | Stop Guidance → strip clears as before | `[ ]` | |
| 6 | `./gradlew test` passes locally on master at HEAD (the 18 new StepSectionGrouper / StepProgressView section tests cover the sectioned-layout paths) | `[ ]` | |
| 7 | OPTIONAL (advanced): hand-edit `drop_rates.json` for a single source to set `section` on a few consecutive steps (e.g. add `"section": "Bank prep"` to step 1, `"section": "Travel"` to steps 2–3, `"section": "Combat"` to steps 4+ on a test source) → activate guidance → verify section headers render with "▼" expanded chevron, active step's section is expanded, other sections collapse on click | `[ ]` | optional pending B.5.4b data |

## PR #441 — feat(overlay): richer worldmap chevron + CLH-distinct color *(merged 2026-05-14)*

Closes #430. Replaces the plain 4-point filled polygon edge-snap arrow on the world map with a `Path2D.Double` notched chevron shape. Arrow fill changes from teal to orange (`#FF8C00`) to distinguish the CLH source arrow from native OSRS worldmap chevrons and Quest Helper indicators. Destination icons (NPC/object/tile) retain their existing teal fill.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |

## PR #443 — fix(charset): force UTF-8 when loading guidance step text *(merged 2026-05-14)*

Fixes #433. `InputStreamReader` was opened without an explicit charset, defaulting to Windows-1252 on Windows hosts. This corrupted the three UTF-8 bytes of U+2014 (em-dash, `e2 80 94`) into `â€"` mojibake in the in-game overlay on Windows. Fix passes `StandardCharsets.UTF_8` to every `InputStreamReader` that opens a bundled JSON resource (`DropRateDatabase`, `SlayerMasterDatabase`, `VerifiedSceneIdRegistry`).

| # | Issue | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | #433 | Activate guidance on **Perilous Moons** → step description containing an em-dash (e.g. step 3 "Travel to Cam Torum — enter via cave entrance") renders as `—` not `â€"` in the in-game overlay | `[ ]` | Primary reproducer from the issue |
| 2 | #433 | Same check in the **side panel** step strip (not just the in-game overlay) → em-dash renders correctly | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | #433 | Activate guidance on any source whose `perItemStepDescription` contains an em-dash → overlay shows the correct character | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | — | Activate guidance on any source with ordinary ASCII step descriptions → text is unchanged (regression check, no corruption introduced) | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | — | Open `client.log` after plugin startup → ZERO `MalformedInputException` or charset-related errors from `DropRateDatabase`, `SlayerMasterDatabase`, or `VerifiedSceneIdRegistry` | `[ ]` | |

## PR #444 — data(cyclopes): per-defender step descriptions (B4.3.3) *(merged 2026-05-14)*

Closes B4.3.3 from #420. Backfills `perItemStepDescription` on the Cyclopes kill step (Warriors' Guild source step 2) for all 8 defender tiers: Bronze → Dragon. Each override names the tier being targeted and the defender that must be held in inventory for the drop to land. The static fallback description is preserved when no target item is set.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | In Efficient mode, identify the Warriors' Guild / Cyclopes source. Right-click **Iron defender** → Guide Me → activate guidance → in-game overlay step description mentions both "Iron" and "Bronze" (e.g. "Kill Cyclopes holding a Bronze defender to receive the Iron defender") | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Repeat for **Dragon defender** → description mentions "Dragon" and "Rune" | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | Repeat for **Rune defender** → description mentions "Rune" and "Adamant" | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Activate guidance on Warriors' Guild without right-clicking a specific defender (no target item) → step description shows the generic static text ("Kill Cyclopes for defender drops..."), not a tier-specific override | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | Side panel step strip: same tier-specific description appears in the panel (not just overlay) when a specific defender is targeted | `[ ]` | |
| 6 | Regression: non-Cyclopes sources with `perItemStepDescription` (e.g. Perilous Moons with per-Moon NPC retarget) are unaffected | `[ ]` | |

## PR #445 — feat(guidance): B4.4 — Top Pick auto-advance carries per-item target ID *(merged 2026-05-14)*

Closes the B4.4 milestone. When guidance auto-advances to the next Top Pick source after a sequence completes, the new session now activates with the per-item target ID set (from `ScoredItem.getBestItem().getItemId()`). Previously, auto-advance always used static 1-arg guidance, so per-item overrides (`perItemRequiredItemIds`, `perItemStepDescription`, `perItemNpcId`) were never lit up automatically.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activate guidance on a source that will complete quickly (e.g. Shades of Mort'ton with all pre-conditions met and all items already in collection log except one). Complete the sequence → auto-advance fires and starts the next Top Pick source | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | If the auto-advanced Top Pick source is Warriors' Guild (Cyclopes defenders), the guidance session should open with the specific next defender tier as the target — verify the overlay description is tier-specific (not the generic fallback) | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | If the auto-advanced source does not use per-item overrides (e.g. a plain kill source) → guidance activates normally with null targetItemId (no regression; static description shown) | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Manual right-click Guide Me on any source still works as before (does not pass a per-item ID from the right-click NPC menu path) | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | Stop guidance and manually Guide Me on the same source the auto-advance would have chosen → per-item target appears correctly via the manual path too (existing path unchanged) | `[ ]` | |

## PR #446 — fix(panel): prevent duplicate tier label on search-result row hover *(merged 2026-05-14)*

Fixes #428. `ItemRowPanel.mouseExited` fired when the mouse moved from the row panel into any child component (icon, name label, source label, rate label), not only when the mouse truly left the row. Each spurious exit triggered `setBackground()` + `repaint()` that raced with in-flight child `JLabel` paints, smearing label text and producing ghost-text artefacts such as `Shayzien helm (1) (1)`. Fix: guard `mouseExited` with `!contains(e.getPoint())` so intra-row child transitions are ignored.

| # | Issue | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | #428 | Switch to **Search** mode. Type "shay" → results load. Slowly hover over the **Shayzien helm (1)** row, deliberately moving between the icon, the name label, and the source label → item name renders as `Shayzien helm (1)` exactly once, no `(1) (1)` ghost text | `[ ]` | Primary reproducer |
| 2 | #428 | Repeat with a row whose source label includes a tier or count suffix (e.g. `Rune scimitar (Slayer)`, `Bronze defender`) → no doubled suffix on hover | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | — | Hover over a row and then move the mouse completely outside the panel → row background resets to default (mouseExited correctly fires on true boundary exit) | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | — | Hover cycle: enter → move to child → move back to row background → exit → re-enter → row stays highlighted the whole time while inside (no background flicker) | `[ ]` | |

## PR #448 — data(auto-completion): Tier 3 CHAT_MESSAGE_RECEIVED backfill for Pest Control and Brimhaven *(merged 2026-05-14)*

Partially fixes #306. Upgrades the final step of Pest Control and Brimhaven Agility Arena from `MANUAL` to `CHAT_MESSAGE_RECEIVED` using in-game chat message patterns verified against the OSRS Wiki. The sequencer matches these patterns via `Pattern.compile(pattern).matcher(message).find()`.

| # | Source | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pest Control | Complete a Pest Control game → on receiving the "You have successfully defended the island!" chat message, guidance auto-advances to the next step (or sequence completes) without a manual Skip click | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Pest Control | Fail a Pest Control round (portals breach) → guidance does NOT auto-advance (failure message differs from the success pattern) | `[ ]` | |

## PR #449 — feat(overlay): B.5.7 dialog highlight polish (color/flicker/primary) *(merged 2026-05-14)*

B.5.7 follow-up to PRs #404 and #406. Three rendering issues fixed: `BasicStroke` now hoisted to class-level constants (`PRIMARY_STROKE` 2.5 px, `SECONDARY_STROKE` 1 px) rather than inheriting whatever stroke was on the context; a `PRIMARY_BORDER_ALPHA = 220` variant added so the first (preferred) dialog option gets a visually heavier highlight; `RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON` applied at render entry for smoother rect outlines. `Click here to continue` prompt always treated as primary.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activate guidance on a source with a `dialogChoice` step. Open that NPC's dialog → the matching option text box shows a **thick (~2.5 px) near-opaque border** | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | If the step lists two acceptable options (e.g. "Yes" and "Continue"), the **first** option gets the thick primary border; the second gets a thin (1 px) secondary border | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | A "Click here to continue" NPC continue prompt → renders with the thick primary border, not the thin secondary | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Open the dialog and watch for several seconds → no border flicker between frames (color-equality cache should prevent per-frame `Color` allocation) | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | Display scaling >100% (if accessible in testing environment) → rect outlines appear smoother due to anti-aliasing hint | `[ ]` | |
| 6 | Open a non-guidance dialog (bank NPC, Doomsayer, shop NPC) → NO dialog highlight appears (guidanceActive = false guard intact) | `[ ]` | |
| 7 | Close dialog mid-guidance → highlight disappears; no lingering border on the widget | `[ ]` | |
| 8 | `client.log` after 5 minutes of dialog interactions → ZERO `Uncaught exception` traces from `DialogHighlightOverlay` | `[ ]` | |

## PR #450 — data(sailing): triage island-instance vs port-based coord sources *(merged 2026-05-14)*

Partially closes #314. Triages all 7 Sailing-related sources for `ARRIVE_AT_TILE` coord correctness. No JSON data changes — 4 sources confirmed RESOLVED (Port Piscarilius dock at 1824, 3691); 3 sources classified NEEDS-CAPTURE (instanced Sailing islands with no static cache coords).

> No in-game validation is needed for the RESOLVED sources — their Port Piscarilius coords (1824, 3691) were confirmed via NPC/dock cache. The NEEDS-CAPTURE sources below require in-game authoring-log capture during a Sailing voyage before their coords can be corrected.

| # | Issue | Source | NEEDS-CAPTURE test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | #314 | Lava Strykewyrm | Sail to Charred Island (60 Sailing required). Stand at the Charred Dungeon entrance. Record `WorldPoint` from RuneLite coordinate display. Compare to current coords in `drop_rates.json` — **expected mismatch** (current coords land in Isafdar/Tirannwn) | `[ ]` | Highest priority — guidance text is also wrong (copy-paste Wilderness text) |
| 2 | #314 | Gryphon (slayer) | Sail to Great Conch island (45 Sailing; fairy ring CJQ). Stand at eastern or western cave entrance. Record `WorldPoint`. Compare to current coords ~(1456, 2880) — expected mismatch (those land ~101 tiles from Aldarin) | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | #314 | Aquanite | Sail to Ynysdail (73 Sailing required). Enter Ynysdail Cavern. Stand at the entrance. Record `WorldPoint`. Determine if coords are static or instance-relative | `[ ]` | May already be plausible if Ynysdail is static; confirm before update |
| 4 | — | Regression: Cutting Squid, Lost Schematics, Sea Treasures, Port Tasks all use Port Piscarilius dock (1824, 3691) → activate guidance on each and confirm the arrival tile overlays center on the Port Piscarilius dockside area | `[ ]` | RESOLVED sources — quick sanity check |

## PR #452 — feat(panel): B.5.1 per-step required-items chips with bank-scan colors *(merged 2026-05-14)*

Implements B.5.1: adds `RequiredItemsChipPanel`, a horizontal strip of 28x28 item-icon chips rendered directly below the step-progress label in the guidance panel. Each chip has a 2-pixel colored border: green (held in inventory/equipment), white (found in last bank scan), or red (not found anywhere). White chips show tooltip "Items can be found in your: Bank". The chip strip coexists with the existing list-style "Items needed:" section added by PR #398.

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activate guidance on **Shades of Mort'ton** (step 1 has tinderbox + pyre logs + shade remains) → a horizontal row of 3 item-icon chips appears directly below the step-progress label in the side panel | `[ ]` | |
| 2 | Item held in **inventory** → chip border is **green** | `[ ]` | |
| 3 | Item **equipped** → chip border is **green** (same as inventory) | `[ ]` | |
| 4 | Item **only in last bank scan** → chip border is **white**; hover the chip → tooltip reads "Items can be found in your: Bank" | `[ ]` | |
| 5 | Item **missing from inventory, equipment, and bank** → chip border is **red** | `[ ]` | |
| 6 | Activate guidance on a source whose current step has **no `requiredItemIds`** → chip strip is hidden (no blank row of empty chips) | `[ ]` | |
| 7 | Pick up a missing item → chip transitions **red → green** within ~1 tick, no panel rebuild required | `[ ]` | |
| 8 | Drop an item while it's still in bank → chip transitions **green → white** | `[ ]` | |
| 9 | Step advance → chip strip refreshes to show the new step's required items in the same tick | `[ ]` | |
| 10 | Open bank (refresh bank scan) then close → a chip that was red (item in bank, scan stale) transitions to white | `[ ]` | |
| 11 | Stop guidance → chip strip disappears with the rest of the step strip | `[ ]` | |
| 12 | Regression: the existing list-style "Items needed:" section (PR #398) still renders below the chip strip; both display surfaces active simultaneously | `[ ]` | |
| 13 | `client.log` after 5 minutes of guidance with step transitions → ZERO `AssertionError` or `IllegalStateException` from `RequiredItemsChipPanel` or `ItemManager.getImage` | `[ ]` | |

## In-game validation pass — 2026-05-16 (unvalidated PRs #454–#476) (in-progress)

The 2026-05-14 cascade merged ~24 PRs across Tiers B/B.5/C/E/F. None have a validation date yet. Pre-validation static review flagged 5 issues (#478–#482) that should be fixed in follow-up PRs but do NOT block in-game validation. Phased walkthrough below.

> **2026-05-16 attempt 1 — not started.** A subagent walkthrough was launched to drive this rubric interactively. Dev client (`./gradlew run`) started successfully on JDK 17 — plugin registered all event subscribers, `CollectionLogHelperPlugin started`, RuneLite frame shown at 13:22:39 EDT (PR #475 verified). However the subagent environment did not have `AskUserQuestion` registered (deferred-tool manifest excluded it; keyword search returned no match), and the background gradle task was then killed externally before any rubric step could be exercised. All `[?]` rows below remain unchanged. Re-run from a session that has `AskUserQuestion` available, or have the parent agent drive the rubric directly using the runelite-dev MCP screenshot tools.

> **2026-05-20 attempt 2 — partial pass.** Parent session drove the rubric directly via `AskUserQuestion` (subagent attempts hit the same blocker as attempt 1; pattern now encoded in memory). Full Pass 2 results recorded at [`docs/audit/pass2-validation-results.md`](audit/pass2-validation-results.md). ~14 of ~50 rubric rows exercised. **5 regressions filed** (#574 GWD step-order cascade, #575 panel text truncation, #576 STOP-button state desync, plus re-open requests on #486 + #487). **2 enhancements filed** (#573 Recommended UX + wiki strategy link, #577 F1/F2 polish). Phase 5 B.5.x rows green on General Graardor. Phase 2 B2 + Phase 4 F1/F2 invocation + C7 C1-C5 retest carry over to a future session.

| 3 | Debug log shows `CrossSourceRanker` running on recalc | `[?]` | not exercised — flag is hidden, can't enable from config UI. |

#### PR #467 — E2 meta-update dating *(merged 2026-05-14)*

| step | description | status | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activate guidance on a source with `metaUpdateDate` set → `MetaAgeBadge` shows the age | `[-]` | 2026-05-20: **N/A** — zero sources have `metaUpdateDate` field set in `drop_rates.json`. |
| 2 | Source without `metaUpdateDate` → badge hidden, no NPE | `[-]` | N/A — vacuously satisfied. |

### Issues filed DURING in-game validation pass (2026-05-16)

- `cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#483` — P1: Hard Treasure Trails panel rendering overlap + step auto-advance failure
- `cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#484` — P2 data fix: wrong fairy ring code AKQ → AIQ for Asgarnian Ice Dungeon sources
- `cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#485` — **P0 HUB BLOCKER**: ARRIVE_AT_TILE auto-advance not firing systemically (reproduces on Royal Titans + Hard Clue)
- `cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#486` — P1: C7 debug overlay incomplete (missing C1-C5 detected state) — blocks Tier C validation
- `cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#487` — P2: C5 "Quests done: 207" vs in-game 179/179
- `cha-ndler/collection-log-helper#488` — **P1 HUB BLOCKER**: F1/F2 sync are config checkboxes, should be panel buttons (privacy-opt-in implications)

### Phase result summary (2026-05-16)

| Phase | What was validated | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — Smoke** | All 6 items attempted | 3 pass, 1 partial (#362 pre-existing slayer/skilling 0/0 bug), 1 fail (#483 Hard Clue), 1 deferred |
| **2 — Dispatch** | Royal Titans (proxy for B6) | Auto-advance failed → escalated to systemic #485. B5 Wintertodt, full B6 Cerberus, B2 waypoints, B3 nested NOT exercised — paused pending #485 fix |
| **3 — Player state** | C7 overlay enabled, contents inspected | #486 + #487 filed. C1/C2/C3/C4/C5 detection layers cannot be validated until #486 fixed |
| **4 — External I/O** | F1, F2, F4 inspected | #488 filed (F1+F2 UX bug). F4 renders correctly, depends on F2 sync working |
| **5 — UI / panel** | Not exercised | Paused — lower priority than fixing P0/P1 blockers first |
| **6 — Build/CI** | Already verified pre-walkthrough | #475, #454 pass; #451 verify on next GitHub push |

### Pause note

Validation paused 2026-05-16 after 6 hub-blocking-or-relevant issues surfaced. Resume after fixes for **#485 (auto-advance)** and **#488 (sync UX)** at minimum — those two alone block sensible re-validation of multiple downstream rubric rows.

## Still-open bugs that closed PR #371 left unfixed

These need fresh validation when a follow-up PR ships the real fix. The "still broken on master" column captures the regression baseline observed on 2026-05-10.

| Issue | Reproducer | Still broken on master? | Fix PR | Verified after fix? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #362 | Category Focus -> SLAYER -> count reads "0/0", no progress bar | `[ ]` | — | `[ ]` |
| #362 | Category Focus -> SKILLING -> same "0/0" issue | `[ ]` | — | `[ ]` |
| #363 | Activate guidance -> toggle Show Overlays OFF -> overlay should clear immediately (not require Stop/Start) | `[!]` | fix/363 | `[ ]` |
| #363 | Activate guidance -> toggle Show Hint Arrow OFF -> minimap arrow + in-game tile arrow clear immediately | `[!]` | fix/363 | `[ ]` |
| #364 | Toggle Hide Locked Content ON -> items with unmet quest/skill requirements disappear from list | `[!]` | fix/364 | `[ ]` |
| #373 | Toggle Show Overlays OFF mid-guidance -> guidance session CONTINUES; only overlay rendering stops | `[!]` | fix/373 | `[ ]` |
| #374 | Efficient mode with locked items -> locked items appear at their natural efficiency position (e.g., a ~17-min locked item sits near other ~17-min items), not segregated to the bottom | `[!]` | fix/374 | `[ ]` |
| #378 | Walk away from the active step's tile mid-sequence -> step does NOT regress to a prior step | `[ ]` | — | `[ ]` |
| #381 | Mid-guidance: teleport far away and back -> hint arrow re-renders without a Stop/Start cycle | `[!]` | fix/381 | `[ ]` |

## Regression smoke test (run after ANY batch of in-game testing)

Quick check that core features still work end-to-end:

- `[x]` Sync collection log: open the in-game collection log widget once -> "Synced N items" reminder clears  *(2026-05-16: synced on login automatically; no reminder appeared because counts were already correct from prior session)*
- `[x]` Bank scan: open bank once -> "Open Bank to scan items" reminder clears  *(2026-05-16: no reminder appeared; bank scan cache restored from prior session)*
- `[/]` Switch between modes (Efficient / Category / Search / Pet Hunt / Statistics) -> no errors, panel renders for each  *(2026-05-16: all modes render; pre-existing #362 bug still present (Category Focus > Slayer / Skilling show "0/0"); the obtained-items render bug appears resolved)*
- `[!]` Activate guidance on a non-Mort'ton source (Vorkath, Cerberus, Wintertodt, a clue tier) -> panel + overlay render  *(2026-05-16: TWO regressions on Hard Treasure Trails — (a) panel rendering overlaps outside its box; (b) step auto-advance not firing, had to manually progress steps. Screenshot: /tmp/clh-validation-2026-05-16/smoke-4-hard-clue-overlap.png. Needs new issue.)*
- `[?]` Stop guidance, restart guidance on the same source -> clean cycle, no orphaned overlays or InfoBoxes  *(2026-05-16: not yet tested; smoke 4 already failed)*
- `[?]` Close client, reopen -> bank scan cache restores correctly per RS profile (verify by re-opening Helper panel without re-banking)  *(2026-05-16: implicitly partly verified by Smoke 1 + Smoke 2 cache-restore behavior on login)*

## Reporting findings

When a regression / failure is observed:

1. Screenshot the in-game state (full RuneLite window, including the panel).
2. Capture the relevant log output (RuneLite `Help` → `Open logs folder` -> `client.log`).
3. File a GitHub issue with: the screenshot, the master commit SHA at testing time (`git rev-parse HEAD`), and the reproducer steps from this file.
4. Cross-link the new issue in the Notes column above.
5. Update this file's status from `[ ]` to `[!]` so the next pass picks it up.

When all items in a PR section are `[x]`:

- Add the validation date to the section header: e.g. `## PR #372 — ... *(merged 2026-05-11, validated 2026-05-15)*`.
- Consider the PR's in-game obligations closed.
- Older sections can be archived to a `validation-archive/` subdirectory if this file grows long.
