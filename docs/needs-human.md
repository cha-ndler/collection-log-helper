# Needs-Human — live-play confirmations the autonomous loop cannot perform

> Rows here require an active OSRS session (login, real network, real account data) and
> cannot be advanced out of game. Each entry carries the in-game recipe so a human can
> confirm it in one sitting. Recipes mirror the style of `post-merge-ux-confirmation.md`.
> When a row is confirmed, mark it `[x]` here and flip the matching row in
> `v1-hub-validation-checklist.md`.

## T1.4 (#488/#577 / PR #795) — external-sync opt-in + failure modes

Code-side opt-in hardening shipped in PR #795 (both sync flags default OFF, descriptions
warn "submits your RSN to a third-party server", consent re-checked immediately before each
request). The remaining sub-clauses are live-play only.

| # | Step | Expected | Confirms |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open the plugin config → **Sync** section on a fresh profile. | Both "Auto-sync collectionlog.net on login" and "Auto-sync TempleOSRS KC on login" are **unchecked by default**; each description reads that it submits your RSN to a third-party server. | T1.4 opt-in default (code-confirmed; eyeball only) |
| 2 | Enable **TempleOSRS** sync, log in with a valid RSN that has KC on TempleOSRS, wait a few ticks after `LOGGED_IN`. | Per-source kill counts populate (panel KC / synced indicator updates); no hang. | T1.4 "sync populates data" |
| 3 | ~~Enable **collectionlog.net** import...~~ **RETIRED by PR #798** (2026-06-10): the importer was removed entirely — collectionlog.net is archived and its API defunct, so this sub-clause is permanently moot. | n/a | T1.4 (closed by removal) |
| 4 | With a flag enabled, log in with an **invalid / non-existent RSN**. | Fails cleanly — clear "user not found" / failure toast, no stack trace, no UI freeze. | T1.4 "invalid RSN fails cleanly" |
| 5 | ~~Offline failure~~ **EVIDENCED LIVE 2026-06-10**: `api.collectionlog.net` DNS is dead in the wild; the importer failed gracefully (`UnknownHostException` → WARN, no hang, no freeze) on a real login. | `[x]` — organic equivalent of the offline test observed. | T1.4 "offline fails without hanging" |
| 6 | With a flag enabled, log in, then **disable** the flag during the few-tick window before the request fires (best-effort race check). | No request leaves the client once disabled (consent re-check at `doImport`/`doSync`). | T1.4 / PR #795 consent re-check |

> **2026-06-10 note**: TempleOSRS round-trip confirmed clean on a real login ("KC sync
> complete: 0 sources updated, 7 skipped" + toast). `api.collectionlog.net` is dead
> (DNS NXDOMAIN) — and PR #798 (merged the same day) removed the importer entirely, so
> every remaining T1.4 sub-clause (populate-with-data, invalid-RSN, consent-race) is
> **TempleOSRS-only** from here on.

## T2.11 (#725) — recurring/subsequent-step item highlight persists past first pickup

The recurring-gather suppression (`isRecurringGatherSequence` — a sequence whose steps carry
`restockIfMissingAllItemIds` keeps the gather step's highlight active instead of
`skipIfHasAnyItemIds` auto-advancing on the first pickup) is unit-tested but never observed
live. Needs real ground pickups.

| # | Step | Expected | Confirms |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Activate Shades of Mort'ton, do a normal pyre loop, and pick up your **first** shade key from the reward pillar. | The key/loot highlight does NOT vanish after the first pickup — the gather step stays live for repeat pickups. | T2.11 (#725/#707) |
| 2 | Pick up a second key (or remains) on a later loop. | Highlight still active; step only advances per the loop design, not on first-item acquisition. | T2.11 |
